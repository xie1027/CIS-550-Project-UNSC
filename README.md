# CIS 550 Project

For our project, we are looking to sync speeches given at the United Nations Security Council debates from 1995 – 2017 – which includes ​77,815 speeches from 5,507 meeting protocols of the UNSC and meeting information such as speakers' names, meeting dates, topics, etc. – and tying the topics (such as Women, Peace, Security, and Climate Change) to various disasters datasets, including conflicts, and natural disaster weather data. This database would easily sort by time, number of disasters, conflicts, or speeches. It would give an overview of the historical context that undergird each of these issues as well as an emerging trend of the key issues in the open UNSC debates.
